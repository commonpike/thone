= Thone - a terminal phone =


Thone is a suite of bash scripts to operate your daily phone: sms, call, etc.
Current version is 0.5. The currently implemented commands are
sms, call, ppl and toggle. It does not yet handle dbus signals, such as
incoming calls, incoming messages or even outgoing calls. These will
still be handled by your default installation. 

To learn the commands, try autocompletion, or '[ command ] help', or read the [Documentation].

=== Install ===

An ipkg would be wonderful. Anybody ?

For now, download the tarball and extract it in root. It will add files /usr/bin/thone-, /usr/share/thone/ , and a pixmap and desktop entry. Thats all. The first time you run thone, it sets up a /home/root/.thone dir.
