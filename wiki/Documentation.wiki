#summary all commands in detail

= Thone =

{{{thone [ jail | free ] }}}

"thone" will start a bash shell with ~/.thonerc as init file. 

When "jail" is added, thonerc will read special config files to change your command line experience - and later, hijack your dbus handlers.

.thonerc reads all config files from ~/.thone/. This initializes all thone's commands. After this, you have the commands below available.

= SMS =

{{{sms [ cmd ] [ @recips | index [ :last ] ] [ text ] }}}

  * Main commands: help list read write config 
  * Recipients: prepend @ to aliases. phonenumbers should be +0-9, >3digits

Examples:
{{{
	>sms @robert howyadoinbro # sends an sms to `ppl robert`
	>sms read # opens an interactive reader
	>sms delete 1:5; sms purge # marks a message deleted and deletes it
}}}
