=TOGGLE=

{{{toggle [-ac] [switch] [state] }}}

The concept behind a 'toggle' command is that a lot of features 
on a phone looks like multi-state switches. GPS is either on or off.
Your profile is either 'plane' or 'work'. What that means exactly is so
diverse, that toggle simply locates any scripts from ~/.thone/bin/toggle.d
and prompts those as options.

So write your own !

If no state is specified, a script called
"report" is run if available. 

If no switch is specified,
all switches are asked to "report".

*Examples:*

{{{
> toggle wifi off	# disables the wifi thru dbus
> toggle sleep on	# sets 'display' to 'auto' thru dbus
> toggle gprs		# reports on the current gprs state

}}}

=Shipped switches:=

===toggle gprs===
{{{toggle gprs [on|off|report]}}}
	Will enable/disable GPRS. Change
	the settings in the script to match
	your provider.
===toggle wifi===
{{{toggle wifi [on|pike|report]}}}
	Will enable/disable wifi networking.
	"pike" is an example script that works for me.
===toggle sleep===	
{{{toggle sleep [on|off|report]}}}
	Will enable/disable the damn brick falling
	asleep every 2 seconds.
