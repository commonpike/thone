= Thone - a terminal phone =


Thone is a suite of bash scripts to operate your daily phone: sms, call, etc.
Current version is 0.5. The currently implemented commands are
sms, call, ppl and toggle

To learn them, try autocompletion and '[command] help', or read the Documentation.

=== Install ===

An ipkg would be wonderful. Anybody ?

For now, download the tarball and extract it in root. It will add files /usr/bin/thone*, /usr/share/thone/* , and a pixmap and desktop entry. Thats all. The first time you run thone, it sets up a /home/root/.thone dir.

=== Dependencies ===

*Current dependencies - afaik:*

  * bash3 (opkg install bash)
