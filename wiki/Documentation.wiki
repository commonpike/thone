The main and first command is 'thone'. 

= Thone =

{{{thone [ jail | free ] }}}

"thone" will start a bash shell with ~/.thonerc as init file. 

When "jail" is added, thonerc will read special config files to change your command line experience - and later, hijack your dbus handlers.

.thonerc reads all config files from ~/.thone/. This initializes all thone's commands. After this, you have the commands below available:

  * [[sms]]
  * [[call]]
  * [[ppl]]
  * [[toggle]]
