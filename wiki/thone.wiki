#summary Doumentation for the 'thone' command

= Thone =

{{{thone [ jail | free ] }}}

"thone" will start a bash shell with ~/.thonerc as init file. 

When "jail" is added, thonerc will read special config files to change your command line experience - and later, hijack your dbus handlers.

.thonerc reads all config files from ~/.thone/. This initializes all thone's commands.
